                    Fashnear Technologies Private Limited doing business as Meesho (short for Meri Shop, trans. My Shop)[3] is an Indian e-commerce company headquartered in Bangalore.[4][5] It is an online marketplace that facilitates trade between suppliers, resellers and customers, with heavy reliance of external social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram.[5][6]
                    Fashnear Technologies Private Limited was established by IIT Delhi graduates Vidit Aatrey and Sanjeev Barnwal in December, 2015[7][8] as an on-demand delivery service like Swiggy but for fashion products from local shops. The startup failed. In 2016, the founders came up with the idea of re-establishing the platform as Meesho, one that would enable country-wide shipping for resellers with the use of social media sites as tools for marketing.[9][4]
                    Meesho had 209,000 users and 1.2 million orders per month in February 2019 and 563,000 users and 3.1 million orders per month in March 2020.[10] It saw big growth during 2021 and 2022.[11] Meesho's monthly transacting user count rose 26 times during 2020–2022. Globally, Meesho mobile app was among the top most downloaded apps in 2021.[12] In 2022, Meesho had about 120 million monthly users and about 910 million orders were made through the platform. It soon became one of India's fastest growing e-commerce platforms.[13] Its gross merchandise value (GMV) increased ninefold in two years[13] and was at about $5 billion in 2022 (for comparison, Flipkart's GMV stood at $23 billion).[14][15]
                    In 2023, Meesho was named one of the most influential companies of the year by Time (magazine).[16][17] In the same year, Meesho also became the fastest shopping app to cross over 500 million downloads.[18][19]

In 2024, Meesho introduced Valmo, a logistics marketplace, to provide shipment services to sellers by aggregating multiple logistics providers. Meesho employs over 3,000 small businesses and 10-12 large firms for warehousing and sorting operations within its logistics framework.[20]

According to a report by The Economic Times, Meesho's Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) exceeds $5 billion, with a focus on fashion, beauty, and home categories. The platform boasts 120 million monthly active users, with 80% of its sellers identified as retail business owners and 95% of its offerings being unbranded.[21]
